                3. Use the information provided to continue the conversation with your partner, taking into account the events and time gap that have occurred. <br>
                4. Be respectful and polite to your partner at all times.<br>
                </p>

                <h4>Step 1: Match</h4>
                <p>
                    When you are ready for the task, hit the <strong>Start Matching</strong> button at the bottom of this page.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 2: Confirm your initial events</h4>
                <p>
                    After redirected to the chat room, you will need to confirm your initial event.
                    You could use this inital event as your current status (we also encourage to use your own initial events
                    that descript your status).
                </p>
                <h4>Step 3: Have the conversation</h4>
                <p>
                    You can input your text in the <strong>Input Area</strong> and hit the <strong>Post</strong> button to send
                    your messages. Your messages can NOT be deleted once sent.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 4: Start a new session</h4>
                <p>
                    Each session require at least one turn from each participant. Both you and your task partner can start a new
                    session at any time by hitting the <strong>New Session</strong> button.
                    Each conversation should have <strong>2 to 7 sessions</strong>.

                <h4>Step 5: Confirm the new events</h4>
                <p>
                    In a new session, you will find new time gap and events. You will then need to continue the conversation as
                    if you have experienced the time gap in reality.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Repeat step 3 to 5 until the end of the conversation.
                </p>
                <h4>Step Payment</h4>
                <p style="color: crimson;">
