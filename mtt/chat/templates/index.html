                <p>
                In this task, you will be paired with another participant and engage in a <strong>multi-session conversation</strong>.
                At the beginning of each conversation, you will be provided with an intial event (e.g., writing a novel,
                having a trip, etc.). You will need to share with your task partner the progress of this event in the subsequent sessions.

                <p>
                We will provide the time that has passed since the previous session, and you need to have natural dialogues as if this 
                time has really passed in your conversation with respect to the progress of the event.
                </p>

                
                <h2 class="mt-2">Instructions</h2>    
                <h4>Step 1: Match</h4>
                <p>
                    You will be matched with another participant and will have several sessions together. <br>
                    When you are ready for the task, hit the <strong>Start Matching</strong> button at the bottom of this page.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 2: Confirm your initial events</h4>
                <p>
                    You will be redirected to the chat room when you are matched-up with another participant.<br>
                    After redirected to the chat room, you will need to confirm your initial event. <br>
                    E.g., <i>You just started writing your doctor thesis, which would take about one year.</i> <br>
                    <br>
                    You are also encouraged to create your own events and subsequent time-based progress. 
                </p>
                <h4>Step 3: Have the conversation</h4>
                <p>
                    You can input your text in the <strong>Input Area</strong> and hit the <strong>Post</strong> button to send
                    your messages. <br> 
                    Your messages can NOT be deleted once sent.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 4: End current session and move the time forward</h4>
                <p>
                    Each session should have at least <strong>20</strong> utterances. However, we recommend all participants
                    to end the session as natural as possible. Participants who provide high quality dialogue data will be rewarded.
                <p>
                    To end the current session, hit the <strong>End Current Session</strong> button. <br>
                    This will move the timeline forward with a random amount of time (e.g. 1 week, 1 month, etc.) and bring you and your task partner to the next session. <br>
                    You will need to have at least <strong>7</strong> sessions to completely finish the task.
                </p>

                <h4>Step 5: Confirm the progress and new events</h4>
                <p>
                    In a new session, you will be provided new information, including progress on ongoing event, life events, world events and future plans. <br>
                    <strong>Progress</strong> describes the progress of your initial event. <br>
                    <strong>Life events</strong> are some events you could have done during that time (something happen to you). <br>
                    <strong>World events</strong> are some events happen in the world (news). <br>
                    <strong>Future plans</strong> are something you will do from now.
                    
                    <br>
                    E.g., <br>
                    In this 1 month, you finished:<br>
                    <strong>Progress:</strong> <br>
                    Review the requirements and guidelines for the thesis.<br>
                    Review relevant literature and research in the field.<br>
                    <strong>Life Events:</strong> <br>
                    You gain weight.
                    You take an online course learning cooking. <br>
                    <strong>World Events:</strong> <br>
                    Samsung Unveils SmartThings Station at CES 2023, Making Smarter Homes Accessible for Everyone.<br>
                    HTC Announces Its Standalone VR Headset.<br>
                    <strong>Futrue Plans:</strong> <br>
                    Write the introduction of your thesis. <br>
                    Design a system to collect data. <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are able to use these progress and events for the dialogues. However, you do NOT have to include every event in the dialogue. <br>
                Make your conversations as <strong>natural</strong> as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Repeat step 3-5 until the end of the multi-session conversation.
                </p>

                        A: Take your time, I don't think that's something can be done in a short time. <br>
